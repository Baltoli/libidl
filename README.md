The IDL language allows compiler analyses to be expressed using
composable constraints, such that they no longer have to be written manually.
This approach facilitates code quality and reuse, improved iteration when
implementing analyses, and has been used to match code to heterogenous libraries
and hardware.

IDL was developed by [Philip Ginsbach](https://github.com/ginsbach). For more
information see the following publications:

  approach][1]

  Approach][3]
